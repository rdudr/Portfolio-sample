# Available Images from Random Folder
# Total: 70+ JPG images found

I'll now update your data.js file to assign these images randomly to portfolio items that don't have images yet.

The images will be assigned from:
assets/images/random/1610183169271.jpg
assets/images/random/1610183169273.jpg
... and so on

Would you like me to proceed with updating data.js?
